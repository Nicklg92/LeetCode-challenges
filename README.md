# LeetCode-challenges
In this repository, I'll regularly share the challenges I do on LeetCode.

For each of them, I report what problem they do refer to on LeetCode, and include in which language I wrote the solution (either Python or SQL), as well as an explantion of the steps for some challenges.

As it is a work in progress, I may further subdivide the challenges by topics and difficulty level.

Also, sharing in general any material I have from NeetCode
