# LeetCode-challenges
In this repository, I'll regularly share the challenges I do on LeetCode.

For each of them, I report what problem they do refer to on LeetCode, and include in which language I wrote the solution (either Python or SQL), as well as an explantion of the steps for some challenges.

Currently top 18% on the platform with 63 solved challenges: 61 easy, 2 medium.

As it is a work in progress, I may further subdivide the challenges by topics, and occasionally review improved version of the challenges.
